# start/stop scripts

Used the following source for the start/stop scripts:
https://vswitchzero.com/mystic-systemd/

# todo:
- tba

# install

## Volumes

If you want to mount your custom mystic install you can mount the volume as below and it will override the fresh install. Do not mount the mystic volume if you wish to use the default install. It is recommended to copy the files after a fresh install and add the docker again mounting your own mystic folder to keep your configuration data outside the docker.

## Logs

To make the usage easier the logs are tail'ed in main docker window as in the following example.

## Ports

Make sure you map the ports from AUTO to manually set ports. If not set manually Synology will set random ports on each restart:

# telnet clients

- MobaXterm (need configuration to get ANSI working well)
- Netrunner v2 (best for mystic and easy to configure)
- SyncTerm
- EtherTerm3
- MT32

# synology correct IP in docker

sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -m addrtype --dst-type LOCAL -j DOCKER
