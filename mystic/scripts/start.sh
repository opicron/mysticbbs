# This shell script will start the mystic internet service (mis). It checks to see if a stale     #
# semaphore is left behind and will also error out if the process is already running and          #
# a start attempt is made. This script can ideally be called as a fork within a systemd .service  #
# file. The script will exit with an appropriate error code to indicate whether is was successful #
# or not. It is intended to work only with Debian, Ubuntu and other debian based distributions.   #
#                                                                                                 #
